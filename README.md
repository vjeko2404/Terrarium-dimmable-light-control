Programmable sunrise & sunset simulator with additional light alarm function and output to a 230V Schuko socket

I made this as a school project in 2022. The device can be used to dim the light in the terrarium. The 230V socket has a maximum output power of 500W.
The device can be connected to the home wifi to automatically synchronize time and location.
Basically, it automatically sets the sunrise and sunset time based on the location.
Read the main.pdf (in german language) in the documentation for more information.
